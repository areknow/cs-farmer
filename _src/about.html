His focus was on commercial and industrial construction was the firm’s primary mission in the metropolitan Detroit area.  Clients included Comprehensive Health Services and Ford Motor Company, where Conmer was a  Minority Supplier Development Program Contractor.</p>
            <p>Conner had a strong relationship with DeMaria Building Company throughout the 1970’s. The two firms successfully joint ventured together on the Ford Wixom Lincoln and Dearborn Engine Plants. In the early 1980’s, he relocated his company to Jamaica for two decades to expand its focus to hospitality, healthcare and education construction. In 2005, he returned his company to his hometown Detroit to share his experience and innovative techniques on how to manage construction efficiently with international standards of quality.  In 2006, Conmer Construction became CS Farmer Construction Company who’s recent experience includes clients such as Huntington Bank, Veterans Administration Department, Marathon Oil Company and Takata.</p>
